## About Our Work

We want to understand how parasitic nematodes infect their host at a molecular and genetic level.
Our research investigates the protein-coding genes and the small RNAs that have a role in nematode parasitism.
We use the parasitic nematode *Strongyloides ratti*, a gastrointestinal of rodents, as a model to understand nematode parasitism.

We have also started working with freeliving *Caenorhabditis* nematodes including *C. inopinata*,
a recently discovered sibling species of *C. elegans*, to better understand the diversity of small RNA pathways in nematodes.
